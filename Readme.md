# Deferred

Tiny `Deferred` on top of a `Promise`, aka a `Promise` without the callback,
you may store and resolve it later. This is a useful capability when working with async/await, where one "coroutine" performs some work, while others wait on the result.

## Installation

```
$ npm install tj/deferred.js
```
